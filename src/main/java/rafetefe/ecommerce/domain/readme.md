Entity concepts differs in-between contexts. While in ORM world, entities represent tables/documents.

Meaning and limits of what entities are differs depending on design methodologies:
Anemic vs. Rich Objects ; clean architecture, domain driven design...

Since I haven't finished the materials that are about architecture; I am not in a spot to dictate a structure.
Therefore, I am going to try to keep it as simple as it meets the necessity.
